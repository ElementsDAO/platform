Incentivised crowd investment platform to fund renewable energy with global scale for a better and green future.

## Preface

Energy is the most useful asset in the world. With endless energy, nobody in the world would starve or die of contaminated water, there would be no wars because of oil or gas and the recycling of waste would not be a problem at all. But we are not there yet - it's a long journey till we have more energy than we would need. But to grow in this direction, we need to invest in renewable energy products, like solar cells or wind turbines. These technologies need to be deployed in a global scale, but in a decentralised manner. But this is a big and expensive effort.

Elements assists local communities to fund renewable energy products and provide experts for planning and a successful deployment. Everyone can participate in project funding, so global scaling is no problem. Investors get incentives through a secure cryptocurrency system, which creates a new economic model for energy production.

### How it works

Many local communities want to be part of the green energy revolution and are planning to deploy solar parks or windmills. Mostly, they join together and create a cooperative, because they becoming a energy provider. So with these initiatives, they do something good and also earn some money with the sale of surplus electricity. To get extra funding, or to build another renewable energy provider, they can send an application with their plans to Elements, where different experts examine the documents. If everything is corrent, the global investors can send the money, and they will also earn some money by the energy sales in the future.

### The Green Economy

Everytime a project gets funded and it's ready for the deployment - all investors get a calculated amount of a cryptocurrency, which you could see as a "investment token". This token can now be traded on different exchanges. The amount of created tokens will be calculated by the amount of energy produced by the planned energy producer.
The token will increase its value over time, because successfully deployed energy producers are forced to pay back and burn tokens on the market with their earnings. Burning tokens means, they will be destroyed, which results in a higher value of the other existing tokens - hold by the investors. This mechanism results in a investment strategy where people invest in efficient energy systems.
